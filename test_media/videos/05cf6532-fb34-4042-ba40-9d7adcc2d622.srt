Welcome! Today we'll explore test uniqueness in software testing.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Test uniqueness ensures that each test case validates a distinct aspect of your system.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's first look at the problem. When we create duplicate tests that check the same functionality,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we waste valuable resources and actually reduce our overall test coverage. This is inefficient and should be avoided.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The solution is to ensure each test validates a unique requirement or condition, like login, search, and checkout.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The benefits are clear: better test coverage, efficient resource use, and each test has a clear purpose. Aim for complete coverage!
